PUPPET IN ANGER
===============

is a collection of blog posts, edited to have a single voice and a common
thread. It was inspired by [ERLANG IN ANGER](http://www.erlang-in-anger.com/),
and, by an attempt of writing a beginners guide to getting started with puppet,
and then getting stuck for a weak,
[shaving yaks](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/03/dont_shave_that.html).

I've always found the Puppetlabs documentation to be good, but not very
beginner friendly. A "beginner" in this context is NOT new to Systems
Administration, or even Automation, or Configuration Management. Just new to
Puppet.

PUPPET IN ANGER is a how-to for people who want - or have to - get started with
Puppet and need a reliable guide-book. It's also a reference for those who got
lost debugging.
